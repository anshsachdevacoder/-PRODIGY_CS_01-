#How to run and use
To run the program, simply download the code and run it in your preferred Python environment. Once the program is running, the user will be prompted to choose whether to 'encode' or 'decode' a message. The user will then enter the message and the shift amount. The program will then display the encrypted or decrypted message, based on the user's selection. The user can then choose to run the program again or exit.

To use this program effectively, the user must have a basic understanding of the Caesar cipher technique and how to choose an appropriate shift amount.
